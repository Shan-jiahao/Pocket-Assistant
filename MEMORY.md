# Project Memory

## Purpose

Long-lived project context that is not already obvious from the code or `AGENTS.md`.
Never store secrets, camera credentials, captures, or personal data here.

## Current decisions

- 2026-09-05: Pocket Assistant has an independent public repository. Its Chinese
  product manual lives in docs/product-guide.zh-CN.md. Product-facing material
  presents Pocket Assistant independently; required Apache 2.0 license,
  copyright, NOTICE, and third-party notices remain in their legal files.

- 2026-09-04: PocketHeadTrack MVP reuses the existing iOS Pocket 4/4 Pro
  BLE → SoftAP → UDP/DUML → gimbal path, `HeadphoneMotionBridge`, and
  `HeadTrack`. It does not introduce a second protocol implementation or PID.
- 2026-09-04: Head tracking must be usable without mounting the live video
  monitor, and every loss-of-control condition must send the existing gimbal
  rest/stop behavior immediately.
- 2026-09-04: Keep English source strings as the fallback and ship Simplified
  Chinese through `zh-Hans` localization resources so the interface follows the
  device language without maintaining a separate Chinese UI implementation.
- 2026-09-04: Simplified Chinese copy should explain specialist terms in plain
  Chinese while retaining useful industry abbreviations such as BLE, HEVC,
  DUML, LUT, IRE, ETTR, ISO, and FPS for cross-reference with camera menus.
- 2026-09-05: The supported-headphone list is guidance sourced from Apple's
  current dynamic-head-tracking documentation. Never gate Pocket head tracking
  by model name: `CMHeadphoneMotionManager` availability plus receipt of a live
  motion sample remains the source of truth.
- 2026-09-05: Fast, Standard, and Gentle head-tracking presets only select the
  existing sensitivity, dead-zone, smoothing, and maximum-speed inputs. They
  must not fork or retune the `HeadTrack` controller itself.

## Operations

- Secret configuration locations and handling rules are documented in
  `SECURITY.md`; values must not be copied here.
- 2026-09-16: Pocket Assistant device and TestFlight builds use Apple team
  `8HS6U9RZJM` with bundle identifier `com.shanjiahao.pocketassistant`. The
  paid-team provisioning profile includes Hotspot Configuration, so automatic
  camera Wi-Fi join is the primary path; manual Settings join remains a runtime
  fallback rather than the default product flow.
- Apple Personal Teams cannot provision the Hotspot Configuration capability.
  For local device-only debugging, use a temporary empty entitlements file and
  a developer-owned bundle identifier at build time. Keep the checked-in
  Hotspot entitlement and production bundle identifier for the paid team/App
  Store build.
- 2026-09-04: The manual SoftAP fallback was hardware-validated with a Pocket 4
  Pro: when the phone already has a `192.168.2.x` camera path, skipping
  `NEHotspotConfiguration.apply` allows the existing UDP/DUML connection to
  continue under a Personal Team build.
- 2026-09-04: A Personal Team build reports `NEHotspotConfigurationErrorDomain`
  code 8 when it attempts automatic SoftAP configuration. Treat that as a
  manual-join flow: preserve the target network, show its SSID, poll for the
  camera DHCP path, and resume without another pairing tap.
- 2026-09-05: A physical iPhone can report headphone motion as available and
  active while producing no first sample after a lifecycle transition. A clean
  restart plus bounded push retries and the Core Motion pull path is the
  approved recovery; re-wearing an earbud and playing audio restored samples
  during hardware validation.
- 2026-09-05: `Pocket助手` is a separate Chinese-first iPhone app target. Its
  stable tab order is Devices, Head Track, Capture; Capture owns the compact
  record and gimbal controls, and the app follows the iPhone system appearance.
  It has no monitor or media workflow and reuses the existing Pocket
  connection/control stack and HeadTrack controller without protocol or PID
  forks. See `docs/pocket-assistant.md`.
- 2026-09-16: A calibrated Pocket Assistant head-track session keeps the
  foreground display awake to prevent idle locking. Manual lock, app switch,
  inactive, and background states still stop the gimbal immediately; iOS does
  not offer a supported continuous AirPods-motion control mode there. The
  bundled Live Activity shows preparation, active, or safely-paused status on
  the Lock Screen and Dynamic Island, but never becomes a camera control path.
- 2026-09-16: Pocket Mode is a calibrated-only, pure-black foreground head-track
  surface. It reduces accidental touch and light while retaining an immediate
  stop action; it exits whenever calibration clears or the app becomes inactive.
